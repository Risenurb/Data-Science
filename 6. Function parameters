# The function is defined by using keyword def

# Function can take parameters/arguments. In a print function we need to change values 20 to something else if we
# need to change number of days. We can create a variable that corresponds to days and pass it into the function as
# an argument
def days_to_units(days):
    print(f"There are {days * calculation_to_units} {name_of_units} in {days} days")


# Our function doesn't have fixed numbers. All those numbers were defined as a variable
# to execute a function we need to call a function with brackets ():
days_to_units(30)
days_to_units(90)
days_to_units(180)
days_to_units(300)

# Note: Use descriptive naming of functions as it will help to understand its meaning easily
